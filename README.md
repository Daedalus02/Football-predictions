# 🏆 Predicting Premier League Results with Machine Learning

### 📊 A Python-based project using Jupyter Notebooks, Web Scraping, and Machine Learning techniques like Random Forest, SVM, and Neural Networks to predict Premier League match outcomes.

---

## 🚀 Introduction

This project, developed by three university students, aims to predict the outcomes of Premier League matches using Machine Learning algorithms. The code is primarily written in **Python** using **Jupyter Notebooks**. The data is obtained through **web scraping** and saved in **CSV** files for analysis.

---

## 📦 Repository Contents

- **`notebooks/`**: Contains Jupyter Notebooks with the code for data analysis and Machine Learning model implementation.
- **`data/`**: CSV files obtained through web scraping, containing match statistics and results.
- **`models/`**: Trained models using techniques like Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks.
- **`utils/`**: Helper functions for data preprocessing and model evaluation.
- **`README.md`**: This file, explaining the project and how to use it.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Development environment for data analysis and visualization.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Library for implementing Machine Learning models.
- **BeautifulSoup**: For web scraping match data.
- **Matplotlib**: For data and result visualization.

## 📊 Machine Learning Models

1. **Random Forest** 
2. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** 
3. **Neural Networks (NN)** 

Each model is evaluated with metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall to determine the best predictive performance.

## 📥 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Daedalus02/Football-predictions.git
    cd Football-predictions
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use 'venv\Scripts\activate'
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Run Jupyter Notebook**:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

## 📈 Example Usage

Load one of the notebooks in the `notebooks/` folder and follow the steps to:

1. **Load the CSV data**.  
2. **Preprocess the data** (cleaning, handling missing data).  
3. **Train the models**.  
4. **Evaluate model performance**.
